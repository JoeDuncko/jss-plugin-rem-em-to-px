# jss-plugin-rem-em-to-px

In certain (horrible) situations you may want all of your `rem` and `em` values to be `px`. You may be making a embeddable widget, writing a component that may be used in uncontrolled environments, or generally fighting against an environment that you have no control over.

It was originally made by myself for The Event Discovery Company's Evitt project, which included a pretty sweet embedable calendar widget. Since that project is being discontinued, I was given permission to publish and maintain the JSS libraries I wrote: this and [jss-plugin-all-important](https://github.com/JoeDuncko/jss-plugin-all-important).

## Install

`npm install --save jss-plugin-rem-em-to-px`


## Usage

```JavaScript
import { create } from 'jss';
import jssRemEmToPx from 'jss-plugin-rem-em-to-px';

const jss = create({
    plugins: [
        jssRemEmToPx({baseFontSize: 16}),
    ]
});
```

## Practical usage

This plugin works really well with [jss-isolate](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/tree/master/packages/jss-plugin-isolate), [jss-increase-specificity](https://github.com/iamstarkov/jss-increase-specificity), and [jss-plugin-all-important](https://github.com/JoeDuncko/jss-plugin-all-important) to protect your styles.

Here's how I used them in conjunction with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)'s default settings:

```JavaScript
import { create } from 'jss';
import { jssPreset } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import jssIsolate from 'jss-isolate';
import jssRemEmToPx from 'jss-plugin-rem-em-to-px';
import jssImportant from 'jss-plugin-all-important';
import jssIncreaseSpecificity from 'jss-increase-specificity';

const jss = create({
    plugins: [
        jssIsolate({
            reset: 'inherited', //Just reset inheritable values - makes no sense to reset anything else I think
            isolate: 'widgetRoot' // Reset from the widgetRoot class - not 'root' because that's used throughout MUI - see https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/issues/326
        }),
        ...jssPreset().plugins,
        jssRemEmToPx({baseFontSize: 16}),
        jssImportant(),
        jssIncreaseSpecificity(),
    ]
});
```


## API
